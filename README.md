This will be updates as progress is made.

Everytime a section is completed, There will be a summary of what exactly i learnt on the day.

## **Numpy**
### *31/08/24*
1. Intro <br>
Showed me why learning Numpy was useful
2. Arrays vs List <br>
Showed me the power of arrays compared to list... the ease of carrying out arithmetics whilst avoiding loops
3. The Dot product <br>
Showed me 2 approaches to calculating the dot product;
  (a) Coordinate definition
  (b) Geomeric definiton (involving cosine)
the former is more commonly used in ML however the latter is also applied as it allows predictions to be made based on the angle between 2 vectors (super cool ngl)
